# Goal of the project
This repository contains the Express/React/Axios project built following the Udemy course on React/Microservices, with tiny personal changes.

## Tooling used
VSCode, Javascript, NPM, a Mac and a Windows box.

## Why the tiny changes?
I build the project based on the explanations, then I check the code based on the instructor's. If the version I built meets the goals and allow the course to keep going without major issues, they stay in.
